- Virtual DOM.
- Server-side scripting.
- One-way data binding.
- JSX.

** Limitations of React **

- It's just a library, not a framework.

** JSX **

- Fullform: JavaScript Extension.
- JavaScript that looks like HTML.
- It's just HTML-like syntax. Syntactical sugar.
- It's totally optional to use it.
- Compiles down to JavaScript.

** Life-cycle Hooks **


- To prevent the re-rendering of child components, we can use shouldComponentUpdate() method.

** Virtual DOM **

- In general, updating DOM is expensive (time-taking).
- Virtual DOM is a copy of Real DOM.
- React doesn't update the Real DOM directly. First, it updates the Virtual DOM, then it makes the updates to the Real DOM all at once.
- Updating Real DOM is slow.
- AngularJS uses Dirty Checking (Digest Cycle), whereas ReactJS uses Observables.
- Whenever setState() method is called on any component, ReactJS makes that component dirty and re-renders it.
- Whenever setState() method is called, ReactJS creates the whole Virtual DOM from scratch (creating a whole tree is very fast). 
- ReactJS maintains two virtual DOMs, one with the updated state Virtual DOM and other with the previous state Virtual DOM.
- If the state of a component has changed, then ReactJS re-renders all the child components even if child components are not modified.
- React uses BST for DOM tree traversal.
* Reconciliation: It is the process to determine which parts of the Real DOM need to be updated.
- ReactJS using diff algorithm compares both the Virtual DOMs to find the minimum number of steps to update the Real DOM.
- Batch Update: During the event loop, there is exactly one time when the Real DOM is being painted.
